= wine-tahoma-fonts =
Wine provides the wine tahoma font family. In fedora embedded bitmaps are
turned off per default (/etc/fonts/conf.d/20-wine-tahoma-nobitmaps.conf) as
this will provide smoother letters for most users.

If you do not like the wine tahoma font experience but want to keep it
installed you can turn it of by adding the following to ~/.fonts.conf or by
adding a file containing the following to ~/.fonts.conf.d/:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
<!-- Reject wine-tahoma-fonts -->
<selectfont>
<rejectfont>
<glob>*/wine-tahoma-fonts/*</glob>
</rejectfont>
</selectfont>
</fontconfig>
