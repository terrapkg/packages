Wine directory structure used in Fedora Linux:
==============================================

${HOME}/.wine/drive_c is the root directory (aka C: drive) wine looks for 
by default. It is created with (empty) C:\windows and C:\windows\system
directories, needed to operate Wine without an existing Windows
installation, if it does not already exist.

If you want to use Wine with an existing Windows installation that is
mounted, for example, in /mnt/windows-c, change the symlink
${HOME}/.wine/dosdevices/c: to point to /mnt/windows-c instead of the
defaults set by installation.

If you do this, you can safely remove ${HOME}/.wine/drive_c.
(Alternatively, just mount your Windows partition to ${HOME}/.wine/drive_c.)

Wine bugs:
==========
If you find a bug, please take the time to move your ${HOME}/.wine directory
someplace and try with a fresh version (like mv ${HOME}/.wine{,-save}). If the
bug is still there look through https://bugzilla.redhat.com and see if the bug
has already been reported. In case it was not please report it.

CJK support:
============
Fedora carries a modified wine.inf file with support for cjk complying to the
fedora default fonts (see
http://tagoh.fedorapeople.org/fonts/fedora-current-defaultfonts.html)

wine does _not_ pull in the cjk font packages automatically. The following
font packages may need to be installed depending on your locale:

zh_CN:
wqy-microhei

jp:
vlgothic-fonts
vlgothic-p-fonts
ipa-mincho-fonts
ipa-pmincho-fonts

ko:
nhn-nanum-gothic-fonts
nhn-nanum-myeongjo-fonts.noarch
